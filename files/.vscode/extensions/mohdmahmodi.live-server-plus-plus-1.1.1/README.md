A powerful live development server for VS Code with real-time reload as you type. Unlike traditional live servers that require saving files, **Live Server++** updates your browser instantly as you edit, providing immediate visual feedback.

---

## 🚀 Features

### ⚡ Live Reload as You Type

Changes appear in your browser immediately without saving files. Perfect for rapid prototyping and iterative design work.

### 🎨 CSS Hot Reload

CSS modifications update instantly without full page refresh, preserving application state and scroll position.

### 🧰 Dedicated Control Panel

A clean sidebar panel provides full control over the server with:

- Real-time server status and port information
- File picker to choose which HTML file to serve
- List of active files with one-click access
- Quick actions for starting, stopping, and managing files

### 🐛 Browser Console Integration

Console logs, warnings, and errors from your browser appear directly in VS Code's output panel, eliminating the need to switch windows during debugging.

### 🧠 In-Memory Caching

Unsaved changes are served directly from memory, ensuring the fastest possible reload times during active development.

### 🌐 CORS Support

Built-in CORS headers enable seamless API testing during local development.

### 🔍 Smart Port Detection

Automatically finds available ports starting from 3000. If a port is in use, the server will try the next available port.

### 🔒 Security Features

- Directory traversal protection
- Path normalization and validation
- Secure default headers
- Request sanitization

### ⚠️ Professional Error Pages

Clean, minimalist error pages with helpful information when files are not found or other issues occur.

## 🧠 How It Works

**Live Server++** monitors your workspace for file changes and maintains a WebSocket connection with the browser. When you type, changes are cached in memory and the browser is notified to reload. CSS changes trigger a targeted stylesheet update without a full page refresh.

**Architecture:**

```
Editor Changes → In-Memory Cache → WebSocket Signal → Browser Update
```

For CSS files:

```
CSS Edit → Cache Update → WebSocket → Stylesheet Refresh (no reload)
```

- **Learning:** Immediate results when learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Prototyping:** Rapid iteration on design concepts
- **Teaching:** Live demonstrations of code changes to students

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Files larger than **50MB** are served from disk rather than cached
- Maximum cache size is **100MB across 50 files**
- Designed for **single workspace** use
- Best suited for **static HTML/CSS/JS** development
- Not a replacement for backend servers with databases or SSR

> For applications requiring backend processing, consider using **Node.js with Express** or similar frameworks.
